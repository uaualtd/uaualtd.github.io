## Information Collection Statement

### We Do NOT Collect Data

## How the App Works
The App connects directly to Trading 212's API using credentials you provide:

1. **Your API credentials** are stored locally on your device only
2. **Your portfolio data** is fetched directly from Trading 212 to your device
3. **All data stays on your device** — nothing is transmitted to us or any third party

## Data Storage
All data used by 212 Portfolio is stored **locally on your device only**, including:
- Your Trading 212 API credentials
- Your portfolio data (cached for display)

No other permissions are required or requested.
