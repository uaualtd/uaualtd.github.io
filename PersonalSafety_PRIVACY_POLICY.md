## Introduction

Welcome to Personal Safety ("the App," "we," "our," or "us"). Your privacy is of utmost importance to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our emergency safety application.

**Our Core Privacy Commitment:** Personal Safety is designed with a privacy-first approach. **We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any of your personal data to our servers or any third parties.** All data used by the App remains exclusively on your device and is only shared with recipients you explicitly designate (such as emergency contacts).

## Information Collection Statement

### We Do NOT Collect Data

Personal Safety does **NOT**:
- Collect any personal information
- Store any user data on external servers
- Transmit your data to third parties
- Use analytics or tracking services
- Display advertisements
- Share, sell, or rent your information to anyone

**All app functionality operates entirely on your device.** The only time your information leaves your device is when YOU choose to send it to YOUR designated emergency contacts.

## Device Permissions Explained

To provide essential safety features, the App requires certain device permissions. Below is a transparent explanation of each permission, why it is needed, and how it is used:

### 📍 Location Permissions

**Permissions:**
- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` (Precise Location)
- `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` (Approximate Location)
- `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` (Background Location Access)

**Purpose:** To include your current location in emergency SOS messages and enable real-time location sharing with your designated emergency contacts.

**How It's Used:**
- When you activate an SOS alert, your location coordinates are included in the emergency message sent to your chosen contacts
- The Periodic Location Sharing feature sends your location to contacts you select at intervals you configure
- Background location access ensures the app can continue sharing your location even when the screen is off or the app is in the background

**Privacy Assurance:** Your location data is ONLY shared with contacts YOU explicitly choose. Location data is NEVER sent to our servers or any third parties. You have full control over when and with whom your location is shared.

### 📱 SMS Permission

**Permission:** `SEND_SMS`

**Purpose:** To send emergency text messages directly from your device to your designated emergency contacts.

**How It's Used:**

## Third-Party Services

### Map Tiles
The App displays maps using OpenStreetMap tile servers. When viewing maps, your device requests map images based on the geographic area displayed. OpenStreetMap's privacy policy governs their handling of these requests. No personal information is shared with map providers by our app.

### In-App Purchases
The App offers optional premium features through Google Play Billing (Android) or Apple App Store (iOS). Purchase transactions are processed entirely by Google or Apple respectively. We do not receive, process, or store any payment information. Please refer to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) or [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/) for information on how they handle purchase data.

## Data Storage

All data used by Personal Safety is stored **locally on your device only**, including:
- Your emergency contacts
- Medical information you enter
- App preferences and settings

This data never leaves your device except when you explicitly choose to share it (e.g., sending an emergency message to a contact).

---

## Data Sharing

Your data is shared **ONLY** in the following circumstances:
1. **When you send an SOS alert** — Your location and emergency message are sent via SMS to contacts you have designated
2. **When you use periodic location sharing** — Your location is sent to contacts you explicitly select
3. **When fall detection triggers an alert** — After the countdown, your location and emergency message are sent to your designated contacts

In all cases, **YOU are in control** of who receives your information.

## Children's Privacy

Personal Safety is intended for users of all ages as a safety tool. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13. Since no data is collected, there is no children's data to protect—the app functions entirely on-device.
